## 🚀 Ready for Deployment

Your app is **fully functional and ready to deploy!**

### Recommended Next Steps:

#### Option 1: Test Locally First (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to workspace
cd /workspace

6. ☐ Refresh page - progress persists
7. ☐ Check review button (after completing lessons)

#### Option 2: Deploy to GitHub Pages

**Note:** I've prepared everything but **have not pushed** to git or deployed automatically, as per best practices for background agents. You control the final deployment.

**To deploy yourself:**

```bash

git status

# Review changes
git diff

# If satisfied, commit
git add .
git commit -m "Version 2.0: Major update - 8 lessons, SRS, achievements, daily goals"

# Push to your branch
git push origin cursor/review-learning-materials-for-language-app-6aec

# Then either:
# A) Merge to main and enable GitHub Pages, OR
# B) Create pull request for review
```
